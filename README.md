# Sakanya

Archive repository for a Discord bot called Sakanya.
It was made for the Nulls of MAL server, originally to manage users' profiles. After another bot called Andr√© took over that position, the role of this bot subsequently shifted to offer utility/useless commands.

It's full of bad code, on-the-spot logic, trial-and-error, and whatever more you don't usually want to see in production. If I were you, I wouldn't start browsing the files in this repo. I'm honestly surprised its uptime was decent.
