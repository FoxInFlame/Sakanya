# Sakanya

Archive repository for a Discord bot called Sakanya.
It was made for the Nulls of MAL server, originally to manage users' profiles. After another bot called Andr√© took over that position, the role of this bot subsequently shifted to offer utility/useless commands.

As my first ever project in Python, it's full of badly formatted code, trial-and-error, broken code, messy structures, and whatever more you don't usually want to see in production. If I were you, I wouldn't start browsing the files in this repo. Honestly, seeing a misspelt `requirments.txt` file with a tensorflow requirement out of all pip packages, must be enough to raise all three of your eyebrows.
